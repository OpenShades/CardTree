CardTree
========

Library for Google Glass allowing more advanced CardScrollViews

I created this library because I wanted to have behavior like the Timeline where you can have bundles.

The source you need to compile against is in the Lib module, and an Example in Example. I'll make a jar for Maven/Gradle eventually.
